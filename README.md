## Why I built this App
I am in a soccer league that does not use modern tools to create a season schedule. I wanted to create a simple MEAN stack application
that would make creating a soccer season easier. There are a bunch of
necessary questions in order to create a season schedule like-
* What is the name of your season?
* How long is your season (weeks)?
* What days are the games played?
* What are the times the games are played?
* Are there any holidays?

My goal was to take these pieces of information and generate a full season schedule. I would also like the UX (User Experience) to be fluid and simplistic.
